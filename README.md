### Data-Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is a process of preparing the raw data and making it suitable for a machine learning model. It is the first and crucial step while creating a machine learning model.

### Regression -
Regression analysis is a statistical method to model the relationship between a dependent (target) and independent (predictor) variables with one or more independent variables.

Regression is divided into following sections -
- Simple Linear Regression
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- Support Vector Regression (SVR)
- Decision Tree Regression
- Random Forest Regression

### Classification
Classification is a process related to categorization, the process in which ideas and objects are recognized, differentiated and understood.

Classification is divided into following sections -
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Kernel SVM
- Naive Bayes
- Decision Tree Classification
- Random Forest Classification

### Clustering
Clustering is the task of dividing the population or data points into a number of groups such that data points in the same groups are more similar to other data points in the same group than those in other groups.

Classification is divided into following sections -
- K-Means Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering


### Association Rule Learning
Association rule learning is a rule-based machine learning method for discovering interesting relations between variables in large databases. 

Association Rule Learning consists the following section -
- Apriori

### Natural Language Processing
Natural language processing is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human language, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.

### Deep Learning
Deep learning is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with representation learning. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.

Deep Learning is divided into following sections -
- Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

### Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward.

Reinforcement Learning is divided into following sections -
- Thompson Sampling
- Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)

### Dimensionality Reduction
Dimensionality reduction, or dimension reduction, is the transformation of data from a high-dimensional space into a low-dimensional space so that the low-dimensional representation retains some meaningful properties of the original data, ideally close to its intrinsic dimension.

Dimensionality Reduction is divided into following sections -
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
- Kernel PCA

### Model Selection
Model selection is the process of choosing one among many candidate models for a predictive modeling problem.

### XGBoost
XGBoost is an optimized distributed gradient boosting library designed to be highly efficient, flexible and portable. It implements machine learning algorithms under the Gradient Boosting framework.
