### Data-Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is a process of preparing the raw data and making it suitable for a machine learning model. It is the first and crucial step while creating a machine learning model.

### Regression -
Regression analysis is a statistical method to model the relationship between a dependent (target) and independent (predictor) variables with one or more independent variables.

Regression is divided into following sections -
- Simple Linear Regression
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- Support Vector Regression (SVR)
