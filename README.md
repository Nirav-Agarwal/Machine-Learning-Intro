### Data-Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is a process of preparing the raw data and making it suitable for a machine learning model. It is the first and crucial step while creating a machine learning model.

### Regression -
Regression analysis is a statistical method to model the relationship between a dependent (target) and independent (predictor) variables with one or more independent variables.

Regression is divided into following sections -
- Simple Linear Regression
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- Support Vector Regression (SVR)
- Decision Tree Regression
- Random Forest Regression

### Classification
Classification is a process related to categorization, the process in which ideas and objects are recognized, differentiated and understood.

Classification is divided into following sections -
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Kernel SVM
- Naive Bayes
